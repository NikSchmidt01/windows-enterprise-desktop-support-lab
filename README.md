# Windows Enterprise Desktop Support Lab

## Project Description
This project simulates an enterprise desktop support environment using virtual machines. The lab was built to practice Windows workstation deployment, Active Directory administration, Group Policy configuration, software installation, and end-user troubleshooting scenarios similar to those handled by desktop support engineers.

The goal of this lab is to demonstrate hands-on desktop support, endpoint configuration, and technical documentation skills.
